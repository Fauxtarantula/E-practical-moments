								Our kit making journey was not an obstacle-free journey. Starting from the decision of which experiment to transform into a kit, we had
								to first go through what does the experiment entails, and what is the apparatus used to carry the experiment. Once that was done, we had
								to see what could be improved from the traditional apparatus so as to make smarter and smaller for the users. Here are some of the early
								designs and sketches.

								Wee Hong then proceeded to designing each parts of the beam in Fusion 360 so that we could laser cut and 3D print the parts. The laser
								cutting of the beam and support stand went fine, but the trouble came when we finished laser cutting the box. Firstly, the screwjack system
								was not working as intended because we designed the mechanism in the wrong direction. The wormwheel is supposed to drive the gear, not the 
								the other way around. Here are some photos of the design and how it fails.

								Furthermore, the box designed was too small to house the Arduino Uno inside. Hence Wee Hong designed a bigger one to house both the Arduino
								and the new mechanism. In the meantime, Wei Zhang and Rakin were programming the Arduino, Wei Zhang implementing the experiment protocol in
								program, and Rakin interfacing with the sensors we had, including calibration. Here is the 2nd version of the box, followed by the code used.

							<h3>
								After Wee Hong had design the final mechanism and Wei Zhang has soldered the electronic parts, Nathan went to laser cut and 3D print the new
								parts. However, the mechanism's threading was a bit off and we had to reprint the part several times to finally have it work, which cost us
								quite some time since the part was quite complex. From that point, we learned for next time that parts should be separated in smaller chunks
								so that reprinting the portion that failed does not take too much time.
